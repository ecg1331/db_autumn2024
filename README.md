1. **`pyscriptsTables/`**  
   - Has the scripts for how I made each table. If they need edits eventually, you will have to change the links to the correct dirs.

2. **`menu/`**  
   - Contains old CSV files of menus:
     - **Food menu**: 100% real data.
     - **Other menus**: Mix of real and fake data.

3. **`pyScriptsDB/`**  
   - Contains the Python scripts for working with the database:
     1. **`dbSetup.py`**: Sets up the database and tables.
     2. **`insertData.py`**: Inserts data into the tables.
     3. **`Queries.py`**: Runs our queries.
     4. **`dbTeardown.py`**: Cleans up the database (drops tables and the database).
     5. **`pyScriptsDB/tables`**:
       - Contains the CSV files that populate the database (that were created in pyscriptsTables)

  We will still need customer and barista tables, as well as allergens and the purchase table. 
  These will be randomly generated (?) so anyone can make those.

  Lmk if u have questions!
