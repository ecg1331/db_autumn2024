# Café and Bookstore Database Project

This repository contains the final project for our database design course. We created a relational database to simulate daily operations for a local café and bookstore, modeled after **Plein Air**.

## Project Description
- **Goal**: Optimize workflows by designing a database that supports menu management, sales tracking, and customer loyalty programs.
- **Implementation**:
  - Designed an **ER diagram** to model entities like goods (menu items, pastries, drinks, books), baristas, sales, and customer loyalty.
  - Populated tables with real and generated data sourced from:
    - [Plein Air Café](http://www.pleinaircafe.co)
    - [Kaggle Book Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/middlelight)
  - Developed a relational schema optimized for efficient querying, reducing unnecessary joins by denormalizing frequently accessed attributes.

## Key Features
- Tracks goods sold, including books, pastries, drinks, and menu items.
- Records barista sales, customer loyalty participation, and daily transactions.
- Supports discounts for paired items (e.g., fall beverages and pastries).

## Implementation Highlights
- **Tools**: MySQL for database implementation, Python for data cleaning and integration.

## Contributors
- **Emma Griffin**
